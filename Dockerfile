# AWS Lambda Web Adapter: a Lambda extension that bridges the Lambda Runtime API
# to an ordinary HTTP server, so this stays a plain uvicorn app -- no Mangum, no
# handler function, no application code aware of Lambda at all. The same image
# runs under `docker run` and under Lambda.
#
# x86_64, and for this service that is not just a default: hdbscan publishes no
# linux-aarch64 wheel (0.8.43 ships macosx, manylinux x86_64, win_amd64 and an
# sdist), so an arm64 image would have to compile it from source against numpy
# headers. Graviton would be ~20% cheaper, which is nothing inside the
# always-free Lambda tier. Nor would arm64 buy a faster cold start: hdbscan is
# imported lazily in app/clustering.py, so it is not on that path at all.

# Separate from the runtime stage so uv, pip's cache and the build tooling never
# reach the shipped image. It is not only size: the runtime image having no
# package manager is one less thing for a compromised request handler to use.
